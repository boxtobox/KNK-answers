how each the following numbers will look if displayed by printf 
with %#012.5g as the conversion specification
   
looking at %#012.5g, this conversion specifictaions contains:

   (1) # flag: in g conversion it makes floating-point numbers always
               have a decimal point and trailing zeros to be shown.
   (2) 0 flag: numbers are padded with leading zeros up to the field width
   (3) 12 (minimum field width): An item is too small to occupy this
               number of characters will be padded.
   (4) .5 (preicision): number of significant digits.
   (5) g: conversion specifier
   
   in g conversion, e form is selected if the number's exponent is less than
   -4 or greater than or equal to the precision
   
   note that rightmost number of significant digit is rounded.
   if actual significant number is less than precision, trailing zeros (difference btw
   act. sig. num and preicision) will be followed after act. sig. nums.

(a) 83.7361
number's exponent is 2 and f form is selected.
00000083.736

(b) 29748.6607
number's exponent is 4 which is less than the precision and f form is selected.
(in %e conversion specifier: 2.974866e+004)
00000029749.

(c) 1054932234.0
number's exponent is 9 and e form is selected.
